###

<p align="left">I'm João from Portugal 👋<br><br>I am a former personal trainer who dove into the world of crypto and NFTs, discovering a new passion for web development.<br><br>My journey began with a growing interest in blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs. <br>As I delved deeper into this world, both as a user and as a member of a NFT project team, it became clear that I wanted to transition into a professional role in the blockchain and web3 space.<br>After closely following the development of web3 projects for several months, I felt motivated to shift my career focus.<br><br>I'm currently immersing myself in web development, having completed several courses and projects in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, with a primary focus on React.<br>My ultimate goal is to solidify my knowledge as a full stack developer and advance into web3 development, where I can leverage the potential of blockchain technology to create innovative solutions and contribute to the decentralized future.<br><br>I'm excited to connect with like-minded professionals, learn from experts, and explore opportunities to bridge my newfound passion for blockchain and web development in the evolving landscape of blockchain technology.<br><br>Regarding my hobbies, aside from crypto, NFTs, and coding, I'm also into bodybuilding and anime. 😁</p>
